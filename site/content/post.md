Many food hubs function as simple points of transit for produce from the farmer (and/or supermarket) to the purchaser. Facilitating a hub can help your budget by 10-15% depending upon the hub-farmer agreements reached.


## Appreciating the history of farms by evisioning a future for farms

Many farms are just waiting to come into well planned action. Good connection between farmers and the community, metorig of ourg farmers, and access to arable land and soils for potted plant gardens is the essece of our shortest checklist.


## What you need to know before committing to running a hub

The community is depending upon you. By using this software you agree to treat other members with due respect, deliver on promises, notify the effected group for changes or loss/ damage/ changes to any food deliveries or dropoffs.  This network is here to assist you in times of personal difficulty, incliment weather, etc.  We are organizing as small work groups to assist forming food hubs with some of the basic materials required to safely and efficiently centralize community food orders

One first task is to construct additional secure insulated or heated / cooled storage areas (sheds) as necessary. With resource efficiency in mind, we are committed to approaches that make use of local resources first. Tinyfood.org seeks to make this a reality.
