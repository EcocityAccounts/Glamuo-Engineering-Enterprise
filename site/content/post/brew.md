Private Eye Lettuce
BY RICHARD BRAUTIGAN
Three crates of Private Eye Lettuce, 
the name and drawing of a detective 
with magnifying glass on the sides 
of the crates of lettuce, 
form a great cross in man’s imagination 
and his desire to name   
the objects of this world. 
I think I’ll call this place Golgotha 
and have some salad for dinner. 


In 1958, designers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is *"one of the best-designed products of modern times"*, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.
