    quote: >-
      Tiny food app design has taken all of my focus and I am proud to be able to provide something useful to the community in support of training new farmers and ensuring that there are reliable markets for their products.  Including 'shared shopping' as an option feels really important to intitially help communities where there local organic farming is limited, to access higher quality food at a lower price, and to participate in Tinyfood's 'organic food family challenge'.
