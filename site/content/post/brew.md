title: How to start and maintain a 'Food Hub'

description: >-
  Starting a food hub can be a simple affair. Tiny food .org is working to provide a one click solution and support for customizing the ood hub in its appearance and features for you.  We are supported by the Colorado not-for-profit business,
  Sustainable Community Development Hub, so please support them with a donation or volunteer time if you have the ability. to make a tax deductable donation, contact greg@scdhub.org.  
  Each hub is designated by its own address xyz.tinyfood.org and is provided free of charge by tinyfood.org and our sponsor scdhub.  We encourage the use of food hubs for small experiments when getting started- like just for sharing the responsibility of picking up groceries at far away stores, as Sue is planning for her hub in Canton, NY, or just for allowing a food cooperative manager to have a real time update from their local farm suppliers, as Casey is plannint to do in Nederland, CO for the Mountain People's Coop.
  Thank you for your interest, and please feel free to send me questions or ideas about how you would like your food hub to work.  Our features and ideas are all derived from the existing openfoodnetwork.org service yet rewritten into a vuex, hugo and netlify-cms based service allowing users to start food hubs at no cost.

Private Eye Lettuce
BY RICHARD BRAUTIGAN
Three crates of Private Eye Lettuce, 
the name and drawing of a detective 
with magnifying glass on the sides 
of the crates of lettuce, 
form a great cross in man’s imagination 
and his desire to name   
the objects of this world. 
I think I’ll call this place Golgotha 
and have some salad for dinner.
